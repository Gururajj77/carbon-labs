## Overview

You can build an accordion using a combination of the `Accordion` and
`AccordionItem` components. The `Accordion` components accepts a list of
`AccordionItem` components as `children` and each `AccordionItem` is responsible
for displaying the accordion's heading and panel content.

You can configure the accordion item's heading using the `title` prop.
Everything you pass in as a child of `AccordionItem` will be rendered in the
accordion's panel.
